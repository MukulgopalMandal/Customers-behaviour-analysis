# Customer behaviour analysis using clustering.
This repository contains a project for **customer segmentation** using machine learning clustering algorithms. The project includes Python code in a Jupyter Notebook to preprocess customer data, apply clustering methods, and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Implementation of three clustering algorithms:
  - **K-Means**
  - **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
  - **DBSCAN**
- Visualization of clustering results.
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance.
- Export of clustered datasets for further use.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Basic knowledge of clustering and unsupervised learning.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
